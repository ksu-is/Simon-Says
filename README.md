# Simon-Says 
This is my repository for my Simon Says code. Simon Says is a program that will display a multi pattern sequence.  Upon completion of the sequence, the user will need to recite the sequence back to the game in the correct order in which it was first shown. The patterns will gradually get harder as the user progresses, and upon failure to recite the patterns correctly, it will be a "Game Over!"
